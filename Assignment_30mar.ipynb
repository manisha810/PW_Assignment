    "Choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression can be done through a process called hyperparameter tuning.

    "There are several methods for hyperparameter tuning in Elastic Net Regression, including:\n",

    "1. Grid Search: This method involves defining a grid of possible values for each regularization parameter and then evaluating the model performance for each combination of parameter values. \n",
