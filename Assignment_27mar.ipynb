    "Based solely on the provided evaluation metrics, Model B with an MAE of 8 would be considered a better performer compared to Model A with an RMSE of 10. The reason for this is that MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is less sensitive to outliers and is directly interpretable in the units of the response variable, while RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) gives a higher weight to large errors and is more sensitive to outliers. Therefore, Model B's smaller MAE suggests that it has lower overall errors, while Model A's larger RMSE indicates that it may have some large errors or outliers that are affecting its performance.\n",

For example, if the data has a skewed distribution, MAE may not provide a complete picture of model performance, as it does not account for the direction of errors.
