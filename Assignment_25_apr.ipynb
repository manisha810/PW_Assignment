It relies on Eigen-Decomposition to identify the principal components of a dataset.

The process involves constructing an affinity matrix based on pairwise similarities between data points and then applying Eigen-Decomposition to this matrix. The eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues are used to embed the data into a lower-dimensional space, where clustering algorithms like k-means can be applied. Spectral clustering can effectively capture complex structures and separate clusters with irregular shapes, making it valuable in various domains, such as image segmentation and community detection in social networks.\n",

The algorithm uses the dominant eigenvector of the transition probability matrix, also known as the Google Matrix, to assign a rank to each page. The eigenvector centrality reflects the importance of each page based on the connectivity of the web graph. This approach ensures that important pages are given higher ranks, leading to more accurate search engine results"
