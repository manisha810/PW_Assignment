By combining prior probabilities of different diseases, the likelihood of specific symptoms or test outcomes for each disease, and the observed symptoms or test results, medical professionals can update their diagnosis probabilities and make more informed decisions.\n",

    "2. Spam Filtering: Bayes' theorem is employed in spam filtering algorithms. Initially, the algorithm is trained on a set of emails, labeled as spam or non-spam, to determine the probabilities of certain words or phrases occurring in spam and non-spam emails. When a new email arrives, the algorithm applies Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of it being spam or non-spam based on the occurrence of specific words or phrases.\n",

Targeted Advertising: Bayes' theorem can be used in targeted advertising to estimate the probability that a user belongs to a particular demographic or interest group based on their online behavior, such as browsing history, search queries, and interactions with ads. By updating the prior probabilities with observed user behavior, advertisers can tailor their ads to specific target audiences more effectively."
