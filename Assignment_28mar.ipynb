    "Ridge regression is a regularized linear regression method used to prevent overfitting in the model by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The penalty term is a regularization parameter (lambda) multiplied by the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Ridge regression and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is that Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the loss function, whereas OLS regression does not. In OLS regression, the model is fitted to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable."

    "The assumptions of Ridge Regression:- \n",
    "- Linear Relationship: Ridge regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.\n",
    "- Normality: Ridge regression assumes that the residuals of the model follow a normal distribution. This assumption can be checked by examining the normality plot of the residuals.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: Ridge regression assumes that the variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables. \n",
    "- Independence: Ridge regression assumes that the observations in the dataset are independent of each other.\n",
    "- No multicollinearity: Ridge regression assumes that there is no perfect multicollinearity among the independent variables. \n",
    "- Large sample size: Ridge regression performs best when the sample size is large, because the regularization parameter needs to be estimated from the data, and a larger sample size provides more reliable estimates of the coefficients."

    "- Grid search: Grid search involves evaluating the model performance for a range of lambda values.\n",
    "- Analytical solution: Ridge regression has an analytical solution for the optimal value of lambda that minimizes the residual sum of squares.\n",
    "- Heuristic methods: There are several heuristic methods for selecting the value of lambda, such as the L-curve method, which plots the magnitude of the coefficients against the residual sum of squares for different values of lambda, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which penalizes the complexity of the model."

In the presence of multicollinearity, the OLS estimates can be unreliable because the standard errors of the estimates are inflated, making it difficult to identify which independent variable is truly responsible for the variation in the dependent variable.."
